# hugo-init
A starter kit for creating a homepage static website with [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io). You can use it as a starting point for development different kinds of page templates, which are allowed in the Hugo (e.g. for a static blog). Please see the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for more info.
For managing the assets (`sass/scss`, `javascript`, etc) this template is using a [Brunch](http://brunch.io) building tool. It's fast tool, simple to configure and expand.

Feel free to expand the abilities of this template to fit your requirements.
Also please note by using this project you understand the implications and guarantees of the [MIT license](https://github.com/serg/hugo-init/blob/master/LICENSE).
## Requirements
Before start you already need to have these applications on aboard:
- [Node 6.x+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS version) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (shipped with node installation)
## Installation
Install all dependencies by running this command inside a project folder:
```
$ npm install
```
## Development mode
Build assets with Brunch and Hugo, start a development server:
```
$ npm start
```
The application will be available at the [`http://localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333) link in your browser.
All changes in the `src/` and `site/` folders will be synced and displayed in browser automatically.
## Production mode
To build the application for production use this command:
```
$ npm run build
```
All created files will be available in the `public/` folder of project.
## Preview mode
To build the application like for production, but with some restrictions use the command:
```
$ npm run preview
```
A website will be generated by applying almost all production features, except:
- all draft pages are included;
- the Google Analytics code is absent on the pages;
- all pages have the rules for prevent of indexing by search engines if you deploy website on a hosting for the testing reasons;
- the `robots.txt` file has a rule for prevent of indexing a whole website.

All above restrictions will be applied for the development mode also, except the assets (`js`, `css`) optimization and minification.
You can find the files of website in the `public/` folder as always.
### Restrictions for production
Your markdown file (in `content/` folder) needs to be not a draft for including its content into a website template. Change the `draft` value to `false` inside a certain page for publishing its content:
```
draft: false
```
All website pages contain the `noindex` and `nofollow` values in the meta tags when website was generated in the development or preview mode. Also the Google Analytics is absent on a page and the `robots.txt` file has an option for prevention of indexing by search engines.
When you will be ready to share your website with a world please run the build of application in the production mode.
## Deployment of a website
